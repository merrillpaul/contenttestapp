<p>When the examinee indicates that s/he can recall no more words, say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue">Now I&rsquo;m going to read the same list again, and once again when I stop, I want you to tell me as many words as you can remember, including words you said the first time.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t matter in what order you say them, just say as many words as you can remember, whether or not you said them before.</span></p>
