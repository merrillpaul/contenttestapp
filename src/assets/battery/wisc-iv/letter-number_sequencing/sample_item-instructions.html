	To introduce the task, say,&nbsp;<span class="speechBlue">Now, I am going to say a group of numbers and letters. After I say them, I want you to tell me the numbers first, in order, starting with the lowest number. Then tell me the letters in alphabetical order. For example, if I say A &ndash; 1, you should say 1 &ndash; A. The number goes first, then the letter.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s practice. A &ndash; 2.</span></p>
