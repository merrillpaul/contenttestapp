<p>Say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">Let&rsquo;s do something different. Count to five out loud so I can hear you.</span></strong></p>

<p>If the child does not understand, say, <strong><span class="speechBlue">Count, like this, 1... 2...</span></strong> (pause between each number)<strong><span class="speechBlue">.</span></strong> Then say, <span class="speechBlue"><strong>Now you try.</strong></span> Allow the child to respond.</p>
