<p>Children will differ in the amount of explanations that they need before testing begins. Use your judgment to decide if elaboration is needed. If the child expresses misconceptions or concerns about the testing, address these concerns in a truthful, nonthreatening manner. Try to avoid the word <em>intelligence</em> because it may elicit unnecessary anxiety. Instead, you might want to review the purpose of testing and emphasize that with the testing you will try to determine which tasks the child does well and which tasks are more difficult for him or her. However, do not deceive or mislead the child about the purpose of testing. Always be truthful and honest.&nbsp;</p>
