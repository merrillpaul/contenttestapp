<p>Say, <span class="speechBlue">When I say go, do these the same way. Start here</span> (point to the first test item)<span class="speechBlue">, go in order, and don&rsquo;t skip any. Work as fast as you can without making mistakes until I tell you to stop. Are you ready?</span></p>

<p>Explain further if necessary. Then say,<span class="speechBlue"> Go.</span></p>

<p>If the child is still working at 120 seconds, say,<span class="speechBlue">&nbsp;Stop.</span></p>
