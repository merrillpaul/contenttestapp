<p>Place page 2 of Response Booklet 1 in front of the child. Fold the pages so that the child sees only Coding B. Point to the key at the top of the page and say,<span class="speechBlue"> Look at these boxes. Each box has a number in the top part</span> (sweep your finger along the numbers from 1 to 9)<span class="speechBlue"> and a special mark in the bottom part</span> (sweep your finger along the symbols)<span class="speechBlue">. Each number has its own mark</span> (point to 1 and its symbol, then to 2 and its symbol)<span class="speechBlue">.</span></p>

<p>Point to the sample items and say,<span class="speechBlue"> Down here the boxes have numbers in the top parts but are empty in the bottom parts. You are to draw the marks that belong in the empty boxes, like this.</span></p>

<p>Point to the first sample item (2) and then to the key to show its corresponding symbol. Say,<span class="speechBlue"> Here is a 2. The 2 has this mark. So I draw that mark in the empty box, like this</span> (write the symbol)<span class="speechBlue">.</span></p>

<p>Point to the second sample item (1) and then to the key and say,<span class="speechBlue"> Here is a 1. The 1 has this mark. So I draw that mark in the box</span> (write the symbol)<span class="speechBlue">.</span></p>

<p>Point to the third sample item (4) and then to the key and say,<span class="speechBlue"> This is a 4. The 4 has this mark. So I draw that mark in the box</span> (write the symbol)<span class="speechBlue">.</span></p>

<p>Hand the child a #2 pencil without an eraser and say,<span class="speechBlue"> Now you do these</span> (point to remaining sample items)<span class="speechBlue">. Stop when you get to this line</span> (point to line that separates sample items from test items)<span class="speechBlue">.</span></p>

<p>Allow the child to work alone on the remaining sample items.&nbsp;</p>
