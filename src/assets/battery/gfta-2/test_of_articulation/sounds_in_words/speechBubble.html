<div><strong>Examinee requests a repetition</strong></div>

<div>Repetitions are allowed when requested or when it appears that the examinee requires redirection.</div>

<div><strong>Examinee responds before stimulus question is read</strong></div>

<div>The question, <strong><span class="speechBlue">What is this?</span></strong> is used with the majority of pictures to elicit the target word. Consequently, you can usually cease to use this standard question as testing progresses.</div>

<div>
<div><strong>Examinee requires a stimulus different than what is provided</strong></div>

<div>You may vary the stimulus text slightly from what is given on the examiner&#39;s screen if you feel that, for a particular child, a slightly different wording of the question would be a more natural, relaxed cue.</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<div><strong>Examinee does not give the expected response</strong></div>

<div>The goal of Sounds-in-Words is to elicit the desired sounds and words spontaneously. If the examinee does not give the expected reply, prompt as necessary. If repeated prompting does not elicit the target word, refer to the suggested cues. You may choose to use either this text or your own words to elicit the target word from the examinee.</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<hr /></div>

<div><strong>Examinee provides a dialectical response</strong></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div>Record and score the response verbatim. GFTA-2 was normed using Standard English.</div>
