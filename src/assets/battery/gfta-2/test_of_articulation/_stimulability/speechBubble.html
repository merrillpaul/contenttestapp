<div><strong>Examinee requires repetition</strong></div>

<div>Repetitions are allowed when requested or when it appears that the examinee requires redirection.</div>

<div><strong>Examinee makes an omission or distortion in Sounds-in-Words or Sounds-in-Sentences</strong></div>

<div>Only sounds that were misarticulated during Sounds-in-Words or Sounds-in-Sentences will be assessed in Stimulability. Sounds will be assessed only in the position that the error occurred.&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<div><strong>Examinee requires evaluation during Stimulability at different levels of complexity</strong></div>

<div>You can test stimulability for misarticulated sounds at the syllable level only or you can test at&nbsp;all three levels of complexity (syllable, word, and sentence).&nbsp;If the examinee succeeds in imitating the syllable, go on to word imitation. If the examinee succeeds in imitating at the word, go on to sentence imitation.</div>

<div><strong>Examinee fails to imitate a stimulus correctly at any level (syllable, word, or sentence)</strong></div>

<div>Ask the examinee to watch and listen. Then follow these procedures:</div>

<ol>
	<li>Say the stimulus three times.</li>
	<li>Have the examinee try again.</li>
	<li>If the examinee imitates successfully after multiple stimulation, continue with the next level of complexity for that sound.</li>
	<li>If the examinee cannot repeat the stimulus correctly after multiple stimulation, discontinue stimulability testing for that sound.</li>
</ol>
