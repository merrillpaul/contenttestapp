<div><strong>Examinee requires repetition</strong></div>

<div>Repetitions are allowed when requested or when it appears that the examinee requires redirection.</div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<hr /></div>

<div><strong>Examinee has difficulty retelling the story</strong></div>

<div>Make sure that the examinee understands that he or she will have to retell the story when you finish. Begin reading the story, pointing as instructed to emphasized target words. The target words are italicized within the story.&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<hr /></div>

<div>
<div><strong>Examinee omits target words from the retelling</strong></div>

<div>Try to elicit target words by asking questions about the picture or by pointing to significant details rather than supplying the word for imitation.</div>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<hr /></div>

<div>
<div><strong>Examinee does not require administration of both stories</strong></div>

<div>You can use Story 1, Story 2, or both stories. The decision depends on the articulation sounds of concern and the age of the examinee. The content of Story 2 is more appropriate for a slightly older child than the content of Story 1.&nbsp;To skip Story 1, do not discontinue: instead, skip each Story 1 item until you reach Story 2.</div>
