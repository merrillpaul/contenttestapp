<h3>Scoring</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Each word is worth 1 point. Any word&nbsp;not marked as an Uncorrected Error before the 15 second marker&nbsp;will be counted as correct.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;count self-corrections or repetitions as errors.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Uncorrected Error:&nbsp;</strong>Occurs when the examinee provides an incorrect response or skips a word, and does not correct the incorrect or skipped response.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Self-correction:&nbsp;</strong>Occurs when the examinee provides an incorrect response or skips a word, but corrects the incorrect or skipped response.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;penalize for articulation differences due to dialect, regional speech patterns, or a first language other than English (e.g., an examinee whose first language is Spanish may pronounce the letter&nbsp;<em>v</em>&nbsp;as /b/).</p>
