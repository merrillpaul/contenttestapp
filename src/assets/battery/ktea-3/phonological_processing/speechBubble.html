<div><strong>Examinee appears to not understand sample or teaching items</strong><br />

<div>
<div><strong>Examinee requests a repetition</strong><br />
You may repeat an item at the examinee&#39;s request or if you think he or she did not hear it.</div>

</div>

<hr />
<div><strong>Examinee says a nonword&nbsp;or real word that ends with the same sound</strong><br />
Award credit if the response rhymes with the target word. Correct responses include ending rhymes that are spelled differently (e.g., <em>stir</em> rhymes with <em>fur</em>).</div>

<div><strong>ITEMS 25</strong>&ndash;<strong>50 (DELETING SOUNDS &amp; SEGMENTING)</strong></div>

<hr />
<div><strong>Examinee does not repeat back the correct target word (e.g., for Item 25, does not repeat back &ldquo;cried,&rdquo; before being instructed to say it again without the /d/ sound)</strong><br />
Re-administer the item. If the examinee does not repeat the correct word after several tries, select the Fails to Repeat (FR) contextual event button and continue administration.</div>

<hr />
<div><strong>ITEMS 36</strong>&ndash;<strong>50 (SEGMENTING)</strong></div>

<hr />
<div><strong>Examinee provides a marginally segmented response to a sample or teaching item</strong><br />
For a response to be scored as correct, the examinee must make a noticeable pause between each part of the word. Use the sample and teaching items to teach the examinee to pause long enough between word parts.</div>

<hr />
<div><strong>Examinee segments a word into&nbsp;three or more syllables (for&nbsp;syllable segmenting items)</strong><br />
Award credit if the response includes the correct number of syllables (and pronunciation); the syllables can be segmented in different ways (e.g., <em>fan...tas...tic</em> and <em>fan...tast...ic</em> are both correct).</div>
