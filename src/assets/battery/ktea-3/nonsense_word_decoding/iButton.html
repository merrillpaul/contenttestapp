<h3>Scoring</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Score <strong>0</strong> or <b>1</b> point.&nbsp;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
<ul>
	<li>Correct pronunciations are shown on the screen and may be heard on the audio file. Some nonsense words have more than one acceptable pronunciation. The syllable breaks should not be applied rigidly.</li>
	<li>For credit, the examinee must say the nonsense word as a connected, relatively smooth whole. There is no penalty for earlier partial or disconnected pronunciations as long as the final, smooth pronunciation is correct.</li>
	<li>Do <strong>not</strong> penalize for articulation differences due to dialect, regional speech patterns, or a first language other than English (e.g., an examinee whose first language is Spanish may pronounce the letter <em>v</em> as /b/).</li>
	<li>Do <strong>not</strong> penalize for misplacement of the accent (i.e., accenting the wrong syllable[s]).</li>
	<li>Do <strong>not</strong> penalize for the American dialectal variation of pronouncing /t/ as /d/, such as saying <em>NUR <u>d</u>ul</em> for <em>knur<u>t</u>le</em> or <em>NOW <u>d</u>ee ist</em> for <em>pnou<u>t</u>iest</em>.</li>
</ul>
