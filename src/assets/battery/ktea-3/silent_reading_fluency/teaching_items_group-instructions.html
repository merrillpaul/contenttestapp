<p>Point to the teaching items and say, <span class="speechBlue"><strong>When I say <em>Begin</em>, read these to yourself and&nbsp;answer each question by marking <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em>. Do them as fast as you can&nbsp;without making mistakes. If you make a mistake, just cross it out.

<p>If the examinee answers all teaching items&nbsp;correctly, proceed to test items.</p>

<p>If the examinee answers 3 or more of the teaching&nbsp;items incorrectly, discontinue administration.</p>

<p>If the examinee responds incorrectly to 1 or 2 of&nbsp;the teaching items, ask the examinee to read the&nbsp;item(s) aloud. Correct any reading errors and&nbsp;teach further as needed to ensure the examinee&nbsp;understands what he or she is being asked to do.</p>

<p>For each incorrect response, prompt the examinee&nbsp;to correct the response by crossing out the&nbsp;incorrect response and marking the correct&nbsp;answer.</p>

<p><span class="speechBlue"><strong>Do you have any questions?</strong></span> (Pause for response.) Teach further as needed, and then proceed to the<br />
test items.</p>
